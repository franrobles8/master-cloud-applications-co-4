To access the app, configure your file /etc/hosts to add the ingress domain:

Add the ingress domain to your hosts file by executing:

{{- if .Values.ingress.overridenPath }}
    echo "`minikube ip` {{ .Values.ingress.overridenPath }}" >> /etc/hosts

Access in a web browser in http://{{ .Values.ingress.overridenPath }} and try to create an eoloplant.

{{- else }}
    echo "`minikube ip` {{ .Release.Name }}-cluster-ip" >> /etc/hosts

Access in a web browser in http://{{ .Release.Name }}-cluster-ip and try to create an eoloplant.

You should also be able to access the toposervice REST API in http://{{ .Release.Name }}-cluster-ip/toposervice/api/topographicdetails/jaca

{{- end }}

Access the server webapp by executing the command and try creating a new eoloplant:

    minikube service {{ .Release.Name }}-server-service
